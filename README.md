# onion-ssh

**Project in the making**

Keypoint is to create an anonym admin ssh connection to a server (through the tor network) every time you want to connect.
- Create an onion service with a custom bootstrapped SSH server behind it. 
- Connect to the server with one-time keys from a client and burn every down when closing the connection.
