# onion-ssh

**Project in the making**

Key-point is to create an anonymous admin SSH connection to a server (through the Tor network) every time you want to connect.
1. Create an onion service (DONE) with a custom bootstrapped SSH server behind it.
2. Connect to the server with one-time keys from an SSH client and burn every down when closing the connection.
